This project is a lightweight log monitoring system built with Express.js for the backend and React for the frontend. It uses two simple JSON files as its "databases": db.json stores all logs with metadata like level, message, timestamp, etc., while wordEngine.json acts as a reverse index for fast keyword-based search. The /logs POST endpoint allows adding structured log entries, which are tokenized and indexed for search, and the GET endpoint returns all stored logs along with categorized filters. It's designed to be fast, easy to run locally, and useful for debugging or log analysis without relying on external databases.
